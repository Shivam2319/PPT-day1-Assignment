/*
ðŸ’¡ You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer n, return *the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build*.

**Example 1:**

  // Example usage:
  const n = 5;
  const completeRowsCount = arrangeCoins(n);
  console.log(completeRowsCount);
